## 🧩 1. **App Overview**

You're creating a **centralized support system** where:

- Customers raise **tickets** (issues)
    
- Support Agents manage **tasks** related to those tickets
    
- Managers **monitor, prioritize, and close** high-level issues
    

This app will live inside **Salesforce** and be accessed via tabs and forms (UIs) created for users.

---

## 🖥️ 2. **User Interface (UI) – How It Will Look**

### 📌 Tabs in the App:

- 🏠 **Home**: Dashboard with charts (tickets by priority, tasks by status)
    
- 📝 **Support Tickets**: List of all customer tickets
    
- ✅ **Support Tasks**: List of tasks linked to tickets
    
- 👤 **Users** (visible to admin/manager)
    
- 📂 **Queues** (High-priority tickets auto-assigned here)
    

Each tab is **clickable** and leads to:

- A **list view** (table of records with filters)
    
- A **form view** (record details like ticket info)
    

---

### 🎨 Form Design (Record UI)

#### 🧾 **Support Ticket Form**

- Auto Ticket Number (like `TKT-00001`)
    
- Customer Name, Email, Phone
    
- Issue Type (Picklist: Technical/Billing/General)
    
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
    
- Status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
    
- Assigned To (Lookup to User)
    
- Description (Issue detail)
    
- Resolution Notes (for manager)
    

#### 📋 **Support Task Form**

- Task Name
    
- Related Ticket (lookup)
    
- Assigned To
    
- Due Date
    
- Status

## 🔄 3. **Workflow – How It Works**

### 🧑‍💼 Role 1: Support Agent

1. Logs in to the Salesforce app.
    
2. Opens **Support Tickets** tab → Sees list of open tickets.
    
3. Clicks on a ticket → Views form (basic layout).
    
4. Edits **status**, adds **description**, or creates related **tasks**.
    
5. Navigates to **Support Tasks** → Picks a task → Marks it complete.
    

---

### 👩‍💼 Role 2: Support Manager

1. Logs in → Sees more fields (e.g. Priority, Resolution Notes).
    
2. Can **filter by high priority** or **technical issues**.
    
3. Can **reassign tickets**, change status to Closed, or write resolution notes.
    
4. Manages **users**, **queues**, and **sharing rules**.

### 🔁 Ticket Lifecycle Example:

|Step|What Happens|
|---|---|
|1|Customer calls or emails a complaint|
|2|Agent creates a new **Support Ticket**|
|3|Agent assigns themselves and updates status|
|4|Agent creates **Support Tasks** for sub-work (email reply, data check)|
|5|Manager sees ticket is marked “High Priority” (via Queue or filter)|
|6|Manager resolves the issue and adds **Resolution Notes**|
|7|Ticket marked as “Resolved” or “Closed”|

---

## 🧠 4. **Smart Features & Automation (Optional but Strong)**

|Feature|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Validation Rule**|Prevent closing ticket without filling Resolution Notes|
|**Workflow Rule / Flow**|Send email when priority = High|
|**Queue**|Auto-assign High-Priority tickets to group|
|**Sharing Rule**|Auto-share tickets with Technical Group if issue = Technical|
|**Dashboard**|Display ticket stats for Manager (Open, Closed, by Agent, etc.)|

---

## 👥 5. **User Management**

|User Type|Permissions|
|---|---|
|Support Agent|View/Edit tickets, tasks assigned to them|
|Support Manager|Full access to all records, layouts, queues|
|Viewer (Permission Set)|Can only view ticket/task records|
|Admin|Create users, manage objects, assign profiles|

---

## 📊 6. **Use Cases in Real Life**

|Use Case|How This Project Solves It|
|---|---|
|Customer has billing issue|Ticket raised with Issue Type = Billing|
|Agent follows up and fixes|Task created and completed|
|Technical error reported|Ticket marked Technical → Shared with Technical group|
|Ticket urgent?|Goes to “High-Priority Tickets” queue for fast resolution|
|Want to check performance?|Manager opens Dashboard: “Tickets by Status”, “Avg Resolution Time”|
